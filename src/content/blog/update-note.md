Hey, it’s been a minute.

Haven’t written here in a while. Life’s been busy in the usual way, but also kind of nice. Figured I’d post a small update just to keep the dust off this place.

## A Small Photo Page

I finally added a [photo page](/photos) to the site. Nothing big, just a few of my favorite shots. Felt like I wanted a quieter place to collect the ones that still feel good after a while.

It’s inspired by [Anthony Fu’s site](https://antfu.me/photos), which I’ve always liked for how calm and honest it feels. I’m not a photographer or anything. Just enjoy taking quick shots here and there, mostly with my old Pixel phone. I switched to an iPhone not long ago, but honestly I don’t really like how the photos turn out. Most of the stuff I liked came from that old Pixel.

I do have a [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/hazymaybelazy/_created/) page. I like how it looks that masonry layout, the way it flows, the calm vibe it gives off. But some of the features kind of suck. Haven’t uploaded anything new to Pinterest in a while. Hazy maybe lazy. Either way, the page is still up.

Thinking about upgrading my gear sometime this year. Not sure yet, but if I do, maybe there’ll be some better shots coming. Stay tune.

## Cleaning Things Up, Saying Bye to Pocket

So yeah, looks like Pocket is shutting down. Got the farewell notice from Mozilla recently.

I really liked Pocket. Used it for years. The layout was clean, the flow was simple, and it did exactly what I needed. None of the other apps really match the way I like to save and read stuff.

Since nothing else felt right, I ended up building my own thing. Just a small bookmark manager called [favoriq](https://favoriq.vercel.app/). Simple style, fast to use, focused on what matters. It does the job, and I kind of enjoy using it more than I expected.

I just wanted a simple way to save bookmarks. Nothing fancy.

The problem was, I kept saving links like I collect books. They sit there, bookmarked, but I never go back to read them. So I figured, maybe what I need is just a clean tool that makes the bookmarks public. Show the URL, group them by category, make them easy to search.

The workflow is pretty straightforward. No heavy backend stuff. I built a small browser extension that connects to a GitHub app. It can read and write to a repo where all the bookmarks live in markdown format. The app reads from that repo and shows everything on a web page.

It works with manual sync or automatic updates when needed. Simple, fast, and I know exactly where my stuff is.

## That’s It

No big ideas this time. Just sharing what’s been on my mind and what I’ve been messing with lately.

I’ve also been working on a few other side projects. Mostly small stuff with that same calm coding vibe. Still trying to practice a bit of digital minimalism too, clear things out, keep what matters.

And yeah, I still owe a couple technical blog posts. They’re coming. Eventually

Till next time,
