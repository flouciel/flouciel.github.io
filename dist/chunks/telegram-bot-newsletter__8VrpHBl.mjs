It's tough to find the most useful newsletters, blogs, creators while keeping everything centralized, simple, and minimal. \n\nIn this article, I want to share how I stay up-to-date on the future of learning and work. Each resource on this list has taught me something new and helped me grow as a lifelong learner.\n\n\n### <span class=\"accent\">Context</span>\nBeing in cybersecurity, I need to keep up with the industry trends, latest threats, libraries, tools, vulnerabilities, etc, so that I can apply this knowledge at my job.\n\n### <span class=\"accent\">Complication</span>\n\nThe first challenge I encountered was information overload. The cybersecurity landscape is continuously changing, with new vulnerabilities and attacks being popping up daily. While I understood the value of remaining informed, the sheer amount of information made it overwhelming to keep up. \n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the challenges I faced:\n\n- Time drain: I spent hours hopping between websites and blogs, manually scanning headlines for useful updates.\n- Missed stuff: Important updates slipped through the cracks because the info was scattered all over the place.\n- Lack of organization: Keeping track of security updates was a mess since they were spread across so many channels.\n\n### <span class=\"accent\">Resolution</span>\n\n#### 1. Traditional Way: Email Notifications\nThe first thing I tried was setting up email notifications for the blogs, newsletters, and other resources I follow. Many security websites and blogs offer the option to receive email updates whenever they post something new.\n\n- Email Subscriptions: I could subscribe to email newsletters or set up alerts for specific security topics or sources.\n- Daily Digest: Most platforms offer daily or weekly email summaries of the latest posts, making it easier to stay in the loop without constantly checking websites.\n\n![email-sub](@assets/images/tldr-sub.png)\n\nThis has its pros and cons. It’s straightforward and helps me get things done much faster, but it does have some drawbacks:\n\n- Clutter: My inbox would quickly get flooded with emails from various sources, making it tough to sift through and find the important ones.\n- Limited Control: Email services often lack fine-grained control over what content I receive and when, leading to less customization.\n\n![email-noti](@assets/images/tldr-email.png)\n\n#### 2. Telegram Bot. \n\nThe second, and I think much better is using a bot to automatically send notifications from my curated list of resources. Telegram is my favorite tool and one I use daily, so it make perfect sense to make it a platform for my knowledge hub.\n\nHere's how it setup:\n\n1. Create a Telegram bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)\n2. Using [RSStT](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot).\n\nAlternative: https://www.newskeeper.io/\n\n3. Create a channel or group to distribute the news. Then, add the RSStT bot as a member and grant it admin privileges to ensure it can post messages in the channel or group.\n\n**Usage of RSStT**:\n- **/sub**: Subscribe\n- **/unsub**: Unsubscribe\n- **/unsub_all**: Unsubscribe from all subscriptions\n- **/list**: Check the subscription list\n- **/set**: Customize subscriptions\n- **/set_default**: Customize default settings\n- **/import**: Import subscriptions from an OPML file\n- **/export**: Export subscriptions to an OPML file\n- **/activate_subs**: Activate subscriptions\n- **/deactivate_subs**: Deactivate subscriptions\n- **/version**: Check the bot version\n- **/help**: View help\n\nHere are some of the security resources I follow\n\n| Site                                                                          | Feed URL                                     |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------- |\n| [Resilient Cyber](https://www.resilientcyber.io/ )                            | https://www.resilientcyber.io/feed           |\n| [The Software Analyst Cyber Research](https://softwareanalyst.substack.com/)  | https://softwareanalyst.substack.com/feed    |       \n| [better appsec - Medium](https://betterappsec.com/ )                          | https://betterappsec.com/feed                |                     \n| [Reasonable Application Security](https://appsec.beehiiv.com/)                | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/qzqvvIt0tM.xml |\n| [tl;dr sec](ttps://tldrsec.com/)                                              | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/xgTKUmMmUm.xml |\n| [API Security News](https://apisecurity.io/)                                  | https://apisecurity.io/feed/index.xml        |\n| [Latio Pulse](https://pulse.latio.tech/)                                      | https://pulse.latio.tech/feed                |\n| [The Cybersecurity Pulse (TCP)]( https://www.cybersecuritypulse.net/)         | https://www.cybersecuritypulse.net/feed      |\n| [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com )                                 | https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHackersNews  |\n| [Return On Security](https://www.returnonsecurity.com/t/Newsletter)           | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/tLSvUYOBwf.xml |\n| [Vulnerable U](https://www.vulnu.com/ )                                       | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/lSfumbrEGk.xml |\n| [Secure All Software](https://www.secureallsoftware.com/)                     | https://www.secureallsoftware.com/feed       |\n| [CSO Online](https://www.csoonline.com/)                                      | https://www.csoonline.com/feed/              |\n| [AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/)                   | https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/feed/  |\n| [CramHacks](https://www.cramhacks.com/)                                       | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/uGY9n2H0Mg.xml |\n\n\nIn this channel, paste the bellow command\n```bash\n/sub <above_RSS_list>\n/activate_subs\n```\n\n#### <span class=\"accent\">The Result</span>\nNow, I have a fully automated system that delivers real-time security updates directly to my Telegram channel, eliminating the need to manually check websites or emails. The Telegram bot streamlines everything, ensuring I never miss an important security update. This setup has significantly improved my efficiency and keeps me constantly informed about the latest cybersecurity news.\n\n<span class=\"accent\">If you're interested with my channel.
