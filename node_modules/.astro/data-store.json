If an app needs to access data outside its directory, like files in iCloud or photos, it must use specific iOS services. This sandboxing means that other apps can't read or alter your app's data, keeping it secure and isolated.\n![app-sandbox](@assets/images/2024-10-15-11-31-39.png)\n\nBehind the scenes, Apple uses UNIX-style permissions so apps run as a low-privileged user called mobile. Anything outside their home folder is basically locked down as read-only. \niOS includes robust measures to prevent memory-related security vulnerabilities. One key method is \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)\u003C/span>, which randomizes the memory regions assigned to each app every time it starts. This makes it much harder for attackers to exploit memory corruption bugs. Additionally, memory pages are marked as non-executable using \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">ARM’s Execute Never (XN)\u003C/span> feature, which prevents malicious code from being executed\n\n### Benefits of Jailbreak\nJailbreaking is about breaking free from the constraints imposed by Apple's App Sandbox and security features. It removes these limitations, allowing users to control their devices fully. This includes:\n- Access to system files\n- Installation of unauthorized apps\n- Ability to tweak system settings that are normally restricted\nIn short, jailbreaking provides root access, enabling a level of customization and functionality that Apple's standard security doesn’t permit.\n\n### Drawback\n\n> **Warning**: Jailbreaking your iDevice greatly compromises its security. It is not advisable to perform this on your primary device. A jailbroken device is for penetration testing only, not for regular use.\n\n- Security Vulnerabilities: Bypassing Apple’s security can expose your device to malware and unauthorized access.\n- Stability Issues: Jailbreaking may lead to system instability or crashes due to untested modifications.\n\n### Run on a Real Device\nUnlike Android, which offers a range of options like \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">Android Virtual Device (AVD)\u003C/span> and other emulators that replicate actual hardware, iOS only provides Xcode’s Simulator. This tool mimics the software environment but not the hardware, and it uses x86 code for emulator binaries instead of ARM code. As a result, apps compiled for real devices won't run on the simulator, making it ineffective for black box analysis and reverse engineering.\n![XCode Simulator](@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-28-03.png)\n\nIs there an iOS emulator? Yes, \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">Corellium\u003C/span> is an option. However, it's an enterprise SaaS solution with a per-user license model and does not offer a trial version. Therefore, for effective iOS app penetration testing, using a real iOS device is necessary to accurately identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\nHere is a useful article which will explain the differences between a real device and the iOS simulator. In short, here’s a summary of the key differences between testing an iOS app on the simulator versus a real device:\n- Compilation Differences: Code is compiled for x86 architecture on the simulator and ARM architecture on real devices, meaning the compiled code you test in the simulator isn't the same as what runs on a device.\n- API Limitations: Certain APIs, such as those for push notifications, camera, and microphone, aren't available in the simulator. Testing these features requires a real device.\n- Performance Constraints: Real devices have less memory, storage, and processing power compared to the simulator. This can lead to noticeable performance differences, especially with resource-intensive tasks.\n- Interaction Differences: Clicking on the simulator is different from tapping on a real device. Buttons that are easy to click on the simulator may be difficult to tap on a real device, affecting usability.\n- Gesture Testing: Testing gestures like pinches and swipes are more challenging with a mouse pointer in the simulator than with actual fingers on a real device.\n\n## Types of Jailbreak\nNot all jailbreaks work in the same way. This page will take you through each type of jailbreak and explain how they work.\n(This section is copied from [ios.cfw.guide](https://ios.cfw.guide))\n### 1. Untethered Jailbreaks\nUntethered jailbreaks can be considered the holy grail of all jailbreaks. They only require the exploit to be run once, either via a website, an app, or a computer.\n![untethe](@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-52-54.png)\n\nAfter that, your device is fully jailbroken and won't require any further action. The exploit will stay on a device even after you reboot it.\nUnfortunately, there hasn't been a new untethered jailbreak for end users in a very long time, and it's likely we won't see one for even longer.\nThe only downside to an untethered jailbreak is that if something goes wrong, it could very well result in a bootloop requiring you to restore your device via iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina or newer). The likelihood of this happening is low, but is indeed possible.\nA few examples of untethered jailbreaks are p0sixspwn and Pangu9.\n\n### 2. Semi-Untethered Jailbreaks\nSemi-untethered jailbreaks have been the most popular type of jailbreak in recent years. This type of jailbreak requires an exploit to be executed every time you reboot or turn off your device.\n![semi-unte](@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-53-10.png)\n\nThis jailbreak works by running the exploit through an app or website on the device itself. Due to the nature of how the exploit is run, however, these jailbreaks are easily removable through their respective app.\nA few examples of semi-untethered jailbreaks include Taurine, Dopamine, and Odyssey.\n\n### 3. Semi-Tethered Jailbreaks\nSemi-tethered jailbreaks are very similar to semi-untethered jailbreaks, however the exploit must be run using a computer rather than using a sideloaded app.\n![semi-te](@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-53-27.png)\n\nDue to requiring a computer to rejailbreak after every reboot, most choose to use a semi-untethered jailbreak instead.\nA few examples of a semi-tethered jailbreak include palera1n and Odysseyra1n.\n### 4. Tethered Jailbreaks\nTethered jailbreaks are not meant to be used by the general public. These exploits modify the device in a way that it requires a PC to even boot at all, even without a jailbreak.\nBecause of this, these tend to only be used by jailbreak developers getting ready for a newer version of iOS.\n\n## References:\n- https://quickbirdstudios.com/blog/ios-app-security-best-practices/\n- https://support.apple.com/en-vn/guide/security/sec15bfe098e/web\n- https://ios.cfw.guide/types-of-jailbreak/\n- https://roadfiresoftware.com/2015/04/will-an-ios-app-run-on-a-device-the-same-way-it-does-on-the-ios-simulator/","src/content/blog/ios-jailbreak-type.md",[27,28,29,30,31],"@assets/images/2024-10-15-11-31-39.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-28-03.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-52-54.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-53-10.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-13-53-27.png","e6dea6b31bf5d045",{"html":34,"metadata":35},"\u003Ch2 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\u003Cdetails>\u003Csummary>Open Table of contents\u003C/summary>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#why-jailbreak\">Why Jailbreak?\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#apples-app-sandbox\">Apple’s App Sandbox\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#benefits-of-jailbreak\">Benefits of Jailbreak\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#drawback\">Drawback\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#run-on-a-real-device\">Run on a Real Device\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#types-of-jailbreak\">Types of Jailbreak\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#1-untethered-jailbreaks\">1.

I was more focused on finding vulnerabilities and running basic tests. But that changed when a QA engineer asked me during a mobile security training session: \"What exactly is inside an IPA app?\"\n\nMaybe this blog post will answer her question and serve as a note for myself.\n\n\n## IPA (iOS App Store Package)\n\niOS apps are packaged as IPA files, which are ZIP-compressed archives containing the app's binary, resources, and metadata needed for execution on iOS devices. Similar to Android's APK, IPA files are specific to Apple's iOS devices and are used to install apps on iPhones, iPads, and iPods.\n\n## IPA Structure\n\n| Name      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| iTunesArtwork      | A 512x512 pixel PNG image used as app’s icon that shows up on iTunes, and App Store.|\n| iTunesMetadata.plist | A property list file that contains developer information like developer name, ID, copyright information, application name etc.|\n|META-INF| Subdirectory within the IPA file stores meta-information. Inside, you will find two more files: \u003Cbr> - com.apple.FixedZipMetadata.bin \u003Cbr> - com.apple.ZipMetadata.plist|\n|WatchKitSupport/WK|The framework simplifies app development for watchOS apps, including managing background tasks, extended runtime sessions, Siri intents, and accessing user information about Apple Watch|\n|Payload| Folder that contains the application data.|\n|Application Binary|The executable file containing the application's code. It has the same name as the actual application. The complete binary analysis is performed on this application binary.|\n|Mobile Provision file|iOS apps are typically installed via the App Store, but for beta testing or ad hoc distribution, a mobile provisioning profile is included to allow installation on specific devices.\n|Code Signature|Check the integrity of the app when the application was released. Any kind of editing or deletion will invalidate the signature.

Inside, all app data is stored. \n\nFor example: Spotify app\n![spotify-app](@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-28-06.png)\n\n- Info.plist: Configuration information, such as bundle ID, version number, and application display name\n![info-plist](@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-27-59.png)\n\n- _CodeSignature/CodeResources: includes a plist file that contains a signature, ensuring the integrity of all files in the bundle.\n![codesign](@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-27-51.png)\n\n- Assets.car: A compressed archive used to store asset files, such as icons.\n\n- Frameworks: contains the app native libraries as .dylib or .framework files\n\n- PlugIns: may contain app extensions as .appex files\n![plugins](@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-27-43.png)\n\n- Multiple .lproj folders represent languages, each containing a Localizable.strings file in XML format for localization.

The contents of the PkgInfo file are the 4-byte package type followed by the 4-byte signature of your application. Thus, for the TextEdit application, whose type is 'APPL' and whose signature is 'ttxt', the file would contain the ASCII string “APPLttxt”.\n\n- *SC_Info:* This folder contains keys which are used for decrypting the app executables. The contents will look like this:\n    - Manifest.plist\n    - Spotify.sinf \n    - Spotify.supf \n    - Spotify.supp\n    - Spotify.supx\nThe .sinf, .supf, .supp, .supx files are used for decrypting, and the Manifest.plist file is used to list all of the relevant .sinf files which are to be used. \n\n- *\u003Cname>.storyboardc/*: Contains information on the layout of specific panels or views in the app. The inclusion of these folders suggests that the app was created with the Interface Builder tool. Several .nib files and an additional Info.plist file can be found in these folders.\n    - Info.plist\n    - 01J-lp-oVM-view-MkI-aN-x20.nib \n    - UIViewController-01J-lp-oVM.nib\n\n## Reference:\n- https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html\n- https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x06a-Platform-Overview/#apps-on-ios","src/content/blog/ios-structure.md",[92,93,94,95,96],"@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-28-06.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-27-59.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-27-51.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-27-43.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-16-27-34.png","38d4751b2f1ada58",{"html":99,"metadata":100},"\u003Cp>When I first started security testing iOS apps, I didn’t really care about diving deep into the details of IPA files.

When it comes to threat modeling, Adam Shostack outlines four key questions:\n\n1. What are we working on? \n2. What can go wrong?\n3. What are we going to do about it?\n4. Did we do a good enough job? \n\n![4-questions](@assets/images/4-questions.png)\n\n Check it out on the website and his books\n\n -> [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org),\n\n -> [Threat Modeling: Designing for Security](https://shostack.org/books/threat-modeling-book)\n \n ### Methodologies\n\nThere are many threat modeling techniques out there, with no one-size-fits-all approach, ranging from very famous ones to deprecated ones. I believe threat modeling is a process that must accomplish our goals and fit our organization. Don't try to wear clothes that don't fit. Hence, I won't mention or cover any specific threat modeling methodologies here. There are vast resources available, and I recommend checking out this [one](https://shellsharks.com/threat-modeling).\n\n### Myths and Misconceptions\n\n>  1. Threat modeling is only for security or developers.\n\nThreat modeling isn't just for security professionals or developers. It's a collaborative effort that involves everyone on the development team, from business analysts to developers to security experts. It's not a one-time activity, but a continuous process that should be integrated into the development lifecycle. Our goal isn't to stop at technical risks. It also includes operational and business risks.\n\n> 2. Threat modeling is only for large or complex systems.\n\nThreat modeling is not limited to large or complex systems, nor is it restricted to startups or mature organizations. It can be applied to entire projects or even individual components. The key is to identify the system's assets, recognize potential threats, and work on mitigating them.\n\n> 3. Threat modeling is only for the beginning of a project.\n\nThreat modeling is not a one-time activity. It's a continuous process that should be integrated into the development lifecycle. After the initial threat modeling, it's crucial to monitor and update the model as new threats emerge or vulnerabilities are discovered. Additionally, any changes in the system's design or architecture due to business needs should be reflected in the model.\n\n> 4. Threat modeling is only for prevention\n\nThreat modeling is not just for prevention; it can also serve as valuable material for penetration testing or red teaming exercises. By leveraging threat models, internal teams can reduce testing time and uncover more attack vectors efficiently.\n\n### Close Thoughts\n\nThreat modeling is an ongoing process, not a final destination. It's not something you finish and feel good about. By expanding our perspective, I think we can see the bigger picture beyond the obvious threats and gain a better understanding of the unexpected risks that lie ahead.

Life’s been busy in the usual way, but also kind of nice. Figured I’d post a small update just to keep the dust off this place.\n\n## A Small Photo Page\n\nI finally added a [photo page](/photos) to the site. Nothing big, just a few of my favorite shots. I wanted a quieter place to collect the ones that still feel good after a while.\n\nIt’s inspired by [Anthony Fu’s site](https://antfu.me/photos), which I’ve always liked for how calm and honest it feels. I’m not a photographer or anything. Just enjoy taking quick shots here and there, mostly with my old Pixel phone. I switched to an iPhone not long ago, but honestly I don’t really like how the photos turn out. Most of the stuff I liked came from that old Pixel.\n\nI do have a [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/hazymaybelazy/_created/) page. I like how that masonry layout looks, the way it flows, the calm vibe it gives off. But some of the features kind of suck. Haven't uploaded anything new to Pinterest in a while. Hazy maybe lazy. Either way, the page is still up.\n\nThinking about upgrading my gear sometime this year. Not sure yet, but if I do, maybe there'll be some better shots coming. Stay tuned.\n\n## Cleaning Things Up, Saying Bye to Pocket\n\nSo yeah, looks like Pocket is shutting down. Got the farewell notice from Mozilla recently.\n![pocket-farewell](@assets/images/pocket-farewell.png)\n\nI really liked Pocket. Used it for years. The layout was clean, the flow was simple, and it did exactly what I needed. None of the other apps really match the way I like to save and read stuff.\n\nSince nothing else felt right, I ended up building my own thing. Just a small bookmark manager called [favoriq](https://favoriq.vercel.app/). Simple style, fast to use, focused on what matters. It does the job, and I kind of enjoy using it more than I expected.\n\n## favoriq . minimal \n\nI just wanted a simple way to save bookmarks. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe problem was, I kept saving links like I collect books. They sit there, bookmarked, but I never go back to read them. So I figured, maybe what I need is just a clean tool that makes the bookmarks public. Show the URL, group them by category, make them easy to search.\n\nThe workflow is pretty straightforward. No heavy backend stuff. I built a small browser extension that connects to a GitHub app. It can read and write to a repo where all the bookmarks live in markdown format. The app reads from that repo and shows everything on a web page.\n![favoriq-ext](@assets/images/favoriq-ext.png)\n\nIt works with manual sync or automatic updates when needed. Simple, fast, and I know exactly where my stuff is.\n![favoriq-workflow](@assets/images/favoriq-workflow.png)\n\n![favoriq-app](@assets/images/favoriq-app.png)\n\n## That’s It\n\nNo big ideas this time. Just sharing what’s been on my mind and what I’ve been messing with lately.\n\nI’ve also been working on a few other side projects. Mostly small stuff with that same calm coding vibe. Still trying to practice a bit of digital minimalism too, clear things out, keep what matters.\n\nAnd yeah, I still owe a couple technical blog posts. They're coming.

It's tough to find the most useful newsletters, blogs, creators while keeping everything centralized, simple, and minimal. \n\nIn this article, I want to share how I stay up-to-date on the future of learning and work. Each resource on this list has taught me something new and helped me grow as a lifelong learner.\n\n\n### \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">Context\u003C/span>\nBeing in cybersecurity, I need to keep up with the industry trends, latest threats, libraries, tools, vulnerabilities, etc, so that I can apply this knowledge at my job.\n\n### \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">Complication\u003C/span>\n\nThe first challenge I encountered was information overload. The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing, with new vulnerabilities and attacks popping up daily. While I understood the value of staying informed, the sheer amount of information made it overwhelming to keep up. \n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the challenges I faced:\n\n- Time drain: I spent hours hopping between websites and blogs, manually scanning headlines for useful updates.\n- Missed stuff: Important updates slipped through the cracks because the info was scattered all over the place.\n- Lack of organization: Keeping track of security updates was a mess since they were spread across so many channels.\n\n### \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">Resolution\u003C/span>\n\n#### 1. Traditional Way: Email Notifications\nThe first thing I tried was setting up email notifications for the blogs, newsletters, and other resources I follow. Many security websites and blogs offer the option to receive email updates whenever they post something new.\n\n- Email Subscriptions: I could subscribe to email newsletters or set up alerts for specific security topics or sources.\n- Daily Digest: Most platforms offer daily or weekly email summaries of the latest posts, making it easier to stay in the loop without constantly checking websites.\n\n![email-sub](@assets/images/tldr-sub.png)\n\nThis has its pros and cons. It’s straightforward and helps me get things done much faster, but it does have some drawbacks:\n\n- Clutter: My inbox would quickly get flooded with emails from various sources, making it tough to sift through and find the important ones.\n- Limited Control: Email services often lack fine-grained control over what content I receive and when, leading to less customization.\n\n![email-noti](@assets/images/tldr-email.png)\n\n#### 2. Telegram Bot. \n\nThe second option, and I think the better one, is using a bot to automatically send notifications from my curated list of resources. Telegram is my favorite tool and one I use daily, so it makes perfect sense to use it as a platform for my knowledge hub.\n\nHere's how to set it up:\n\n1. Create a Telegram bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)\n2. Using [RSStT](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot).\n\nAlternative: https://www.newskeeper.io/\n\n3. Create a channel or group to distribute the news. Then, add the RSStT bot as a member and grant it admin privileges to ensure it can post messages in the channel or group.\n\n**Usage of RSStT**:\n- **/sub**: Subscribe\n- **/unsub**: Unsubscribe\n- **/unsub_all**: Unsubscribe from all subscriptions\n- **/list**: Check the subscription list\n- **/set**: Customize subscriptions\n- **/set_default**: Customize default settings\n- **/import**: Import subscriptions from an OPML file\n- **/export**: Export subscriptions to an OPML file\n- **/activate_subs**: Activate subscriptions\n- **/deactivate_subs**: Deactivate subscriptions\n- **/version**: Check the bot version\n- **/help**: View help\n\nHere are some of the security resources I follow\n\n| Site                                                                          | Feed URL                                     |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------- |\n| [Resilient Cyber](https://www.resilientcyber.io/ )                            | https://www.resilientcyber.io/feed           |\n| [The Software Analyst Cyber Research](https://softwareanalyst.substack.com/)  | https://softwareanalyst.substack.com/feed    |       \n| [better appsec - Medium](https://betterappsec.com/ )                          | https://betterappsec.com/feed                |                     \n| [Reasonable Application Security](https://appsec.beehiiv.com/)                | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/qzqvvIt0tM.xml |\n| [tl;dr sec](ttps://tldrsec.com/)                                              | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/xgTKUmMmUm.xml |\n| [API Security News](https://apisecurity.io/)                                  | https://apisecurity.io/feed/index.xml        |\n| [Latio Pulse](https://pulse.latio.tech/)                                      | https://pulse.latio.tech/feed                |\n| [The Cybersecurity Pulse (TCP)]( https://www.cybersecuritypulse.net/)         | https://www.cybersecuritypulse.net/feed      |\n| [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com )                                 | https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHackersNews  |\n| [Return On Security](https://www.returnonsecurity.com/t/Newsletter)           | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/tLSvUYOBwf.xml |\n| [Vulnerable U](https://www.vulnu.com/ )                                       | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/lSfumbrEGk.xml |\n| [Secure All Software](https://www.secureallsoftware.com/)                     | https://www.secureallsoftware.com/feed       |\n| [CSO Online](https://www.csoonline.com/)                                      | https://www.csoonline.com/feed/              |\n| [AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/)                   | https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/feed/  |\n| [CramHacks](https://www.cramhacks.com/)                                       | https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/uGY9n2H0Mg.xml |\n\n\nIn this channel, paste the command below\n```bash\n/sub \u003Cabove_RSS_list>\n/activate_subs\n```\n\n#### \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">The Result\u003C/span>\nNow I have a fully automated system that delivers real-time security updates directly to my Telegram channel.

It's not because they aren't concerned about security. They understand the risks of exposed secrets. But real-world development is messy and often siloed, filled with challenges that make security an afterthought. \n\nWe all have deep respect for our developers. They're brilliant problem solvers and deeply knowledgeable about their code. Deadlines are tight, so many features are in the queue, debugging needs to be fast, and occasionally, developers just need to get things done. Extra security steps end up in the backlog with the seatbelt note *\"Will remove later\"*.\n\n![sleep-meme](@assets/images/sleep-meme.png)\n\n## It's not a bug, it's human nature\n\nHardcoding a secret is fast, visible, and “just works.” Here's why it happens:\n\n#### \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">A false sense of security\u003C/span>\n- *\"It's just an internal repo\"*\n- *\"Only our team has access\"*\n- *\"It's buried deep in code, no one will find it\"*\n\nThese assumptions seem fine, until something leaks. Internal repos get exposed. Access controls fail. A misconfigured `.gitignore` or rogue backup might push secrets into public view. And then that “temporary” AWS key becomes a ticking time bomb.\n\n#### \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">Speed over Security \u003C/span>\n\nWhen time is short, convenience wins:\n- Rapid prototyping? Just drop in an API key.\n- Debugging? Hard coded creds.\n- Collaborating? Share keys in the repo.\n\t\t\nIt's always meant to be temporary, until it isn't.\n\n#### \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">The unintentional mistake\u003C/span>\n\nNot all hard coded secrets are intentional. Sometimes they sneak in:\n\n- Test credentials get left in the final commit.\n- Copied snippet from Stack Overflow or AI generated includes an embedded key.\n- `.env` files get uploaded because of a `.gitignore` misconfig.\n\nNo one intends to leak secrets. But all it takes is one slip, one commit, and it’s out there. When security depends on remembering an extra step, mistakes happen. A secret meant to be removed later gets forgotten. A test credential sneaks into production. A private repo becomes public. Suddenly, what seemed like a harmless shortcut becomes a full-blown security incident.\n\n## The Real Cost of Leaked Secrets\n\nThe worst part? We don't see the cost of a secret leak until it's leaked. Maybe the key gets revoked, maybe a service goes down, maybe your AWS bill spikes overnight. Or worse, your app gets compromised.\n\nSecrets in code are **a risk multiplier**, silent and growing until they explode. [IBM Report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach)\n\n### How Do We Catch This?\n\nWe don't just enforce security. We work with developers, not against them. Security should integrate smoothly into their daily SDLC, which is called AppSec processes, without slowing teams down.\n\n#### A Real World Example\n\nLet's say we're working at a **blitzscaling startup**, where the product is developing at lightning speed to hit MVP and keep up with agile demands. \n\n- Speed > Security\n- No budget for fancy security tools (commercial)\n- Developers commit secrets because \"it's internal\"\n\nThe challenge? Detect and manage secrets **at scale**, using **open source** tools.\n\n### Solution 1: Gitleaks + GitLab CI (other tools work as well)\n\nWe integrated [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) into GitLab CI pipelines using **centralized templates**.\n\nInstead of configuring every repo manually, we:\n1. Created a shared security config in a **centralized DevOps repo**\n2. Stored rules in **S3** for versioning and audit\n3. Used GitLab’s `include` system to import the scanner to each project’s pipeline\n4. Uploaded all **scan results to S3** for centralized review\n\n![gitleaks-diagram](@assets/images/gitleaks-diagram.png)\n\nHere is the sample of gitleaks-ci.yml\n```yaml\nstages:\n  - secret-detection\n\n.gitleaks-rules: &gitleaks-rules\n  image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/aws-base:latest\n  stage: secret-detection\n  tags:\n    - test-security\n  script:\n    - aws s3 cp s3://share//gitlab-ci/security/gitleaks-rules.toml \"$CI_PROJECT_DIR\"/gitleaks-rules.toml\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - gitleaks-rules.toml\n\n.gitleaks-scan: &gitleaks-scan\n  image:\n    name: path/dev-gitleaks:latest\n    entrypoint: [\"\"]\n  stage: secret-detection\n \n  tags:\n    - test-security\n  needs: []\n  variables:\n    GIT_DEPTH: 0\n  before_script:\n    - git config --global --add safe.directory \"${CI_PROJECT_DIR}\"\n  script:\n    - gitleaks detect --config gitleaks-rules.toml ${TRACE+--log-level debug} --report-path gitleaks.output.json\n  artifacts:\n    name: \"$CI_JOB_NAME artifacts from $CI_PROJECT_NAME on $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\"\n    when: always\n    paths:\n      - gitleaks.*\n\n.gitleaks-output-upload-to-s3: &gitleaks-output-upload-to-s3\n  stage: secret-detection\n  tags:\n    - test-security\n  needs:\n    - gitleaks-scan\n  image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/aws-base:latest\n  script:\n    - aws s3 cp gitleaks.* s3://secret-scan/$CI_PROJECT_NAME/$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH/\n    - echo \"uploaded successfully\"\n```\n\n### Solution 2: Trufflehog\n\n[TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) is another powerful tool in your secrets detection toolbox. It scans Git history, file systems, Docker images, PDFs, and more, using over 800+ detectors to find secrets. What sets it apart? It doesn't just match patterns. It can verify secrets against live APIs when supported (like AWS, GitHub, etc.), helping cut down on false positives.\n\nUnlike GitHub, GitLab requires authentication for API access, even for public projects. So to scan GitLab repos, you'll need to pass your personal access token (PAT) to TruffleHog using --token.\n\nAnd if your org uses self-hosted GitLab, make sure to specify the API endpoint.\n```shell\ntrufflehog gitlab \\\n  --endpoint=https://gitlab.url \\\n  --token=glpat-xxxxxxx \\\n  -j | tee gitlab_secret_output.json\n\n```\n\n## Final thoughts\nAfter detecting the secrets, simply deleting a secret from the latest commit **does not mean it's gone**. It's already in history, caches, forks, and clones. Attackers and automated tools can still find and exploit it.\n\nDefault rules won't catch everything. Tailor regex patterns and allowlists to your business. Every org has unique identifiers. Reflect those in your detection config, whether you're using Gitleaks, TruffleHog, or both.\n\nSome next moves: \n- Use a centralized secret manager like **AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Doppler** \n- Always layer secret detection with pre-commit hooks.\n- Security awareness: work with your teams and educate them\n- Rotate and monitor secrets","src/content/blog/hard-coded-scanning.md",[269,270],"@assets/images/sleep-meme.png","@assets/images/gitleaks-diagram.png","c7dc94436c2fdec2",{"html":273,"metadata":274},"\u003Ch2 id=\"the-backstage\">The Backstage\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>If secrets are so sensitive, why do developers still hard code them in the codebase?

Here’s the straight-up advice:\n\n> **Ask your mobile developer.**  \n> *(Seriously… and also, kind of joking.)*\n\nWhen it comes to mobile security testing, most of the time clients or developers will hand you the IPA file, especially if you make it clear that it is part of your requirements. They might email it to you or share it through development-focused platforms like TestFlight, Visual Studio App Center, or Firebase App Distribution. It really depends on their workflow. \n\nSometimes, instead of waiting for someone to send the file, there are ways to get it yourself.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n## Method 1: Pull from the App Store \n\nIf you want to grab an IPA straight from the App Store, [ipatool](https://github.com/majd/ipatool) is your friend. It’s a command‑line tool that lets you download IPA files using your Apple ID, basically acting like a headless App Store client.\n\n### Installation (Mac Homebrew)\n\n``` shell\n$ brew tap majd/repo\n$ brew install ipatool\n```\n### Usage\n\nYou need your Apple ID credentials for this tool to authenticate, just like a real App Store client.\n\n![ipatool-cli](@assets/images/2024-10-15-15-32-00.png)\n\n``` shell\n$ ipatool auth\n$ ipatool search Spotify\n$ ipatool download -b com.spotify.client -o spotify.ipa\n```\n## Method 2: Extract from Jailbroken Device\n\nIf you have a jailbroken device lying around, you can dump the decrypted IPA directly from the system. Since the app is already decrypted at runtime, this method gives you a clean package for analysis.\n\n### Opt A: Frida-ios-dump\nThis tool uses Frida under the hood to dump decrypted versions of apps from the device.\n\n> https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump\n\nNote: This approach can be hit-or-miss depending on your iOS version, device, and Frida compatibility. I’ve run into plenty of issues with it, so if it gives you trouble, try the next option.\n\n### Opt B: Bagbak\n\nA much more stable alternative in most cases.\n\n> https://github.com/ChiChou/bagbak\n\n``` shell\nnpm install -g bagbak\n```\n\nUse bagbak to decrypt the application and extract it from the iPhone. (Remember to set SSH username to root, password is alpine)\n\n```shell\nexport SSH_USERNAME=root\n✦ ➜ bagbak com.apple.iBooks\n[info] pulling app bundle from device, please be patient\n[info] downloaded 682 files and 511 folders\n[info] app bundle downloaded\n....\nSaved to com.apple.iBooks-9.4.ipa\n```","src/content/blog/acquiring-ipa.md",[326],"@assets/images/2024-10-15-15-32-00.png","b01817178397bb59",{"html":329,"metadata":330},"\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR:\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Need the IPA file for an iOS app?

Here’s how jailbreaking works, what’s restrictive about iOS, and how to get around it","Recently, I jumped back into security testing for our internal mobile app at work. I needed to set up a testing environment, buy new devices, and root them. I also started rooting my old Pixel 4, but I didn’t take detailed notes, so I’m not prepared to turn that into a proper blog post, maybe next time. This is a quick wrap-up of what I did on the iPhone side.\n\nSo here we are, a guide to jailbreaking an iPhone. If you're new to the term jailbreaking, take a few seconds to check out my [other post](/posts/ios-jailbreak-type).\n\n## Table of contents\n\n## Pre-jailbreak\n\nBefore we get started, let’s check what I have: an iPhone X running iOS 16.7.2. I chose this device because it strikes a balance, new enough to test modern apps but not too new to tackle the difficulties of jailbreaking. Then, select the appropriate method for jailbreaking at [ios.cfw.guide.](https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started)\n\nFor devices like the iPhone X (A11 chip), Palera1n is currently the most reliable jailbreak option. It’s built on the unpatchable [checkm8](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit) exploit, so it works consistently across supported iOS versions without depending on new vulnerabilities. In short, if your device is A5 - A11, Palera1n is the go to.\n\n## Jailbreak with [Palera1n](https://palera.in/)\n```console\n- palera1n\n- MacOS\n- iPhone X, version 16.7.2\n- Must use USB-A to Lightning cable due to compatibility issues when entering DFU mode. \n```\n\nStep 1. Remove Passcode in iPhone. Connect iPhone to Mac with a cable, then Click \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">“Trust”\u003C/span> this computer.\n\nStep 2: Install palera1n tool\n\n```bash\nsudo /bin/sh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://static.palera.in/scripts/install.sh)\"\n```\nStep 3: Run palera1n on command line\nupdate: palera1n -l\n![palera1n-cli-1](@assets/images/palera1n-l.png)\n\nStep 4: Enter and follow the instruction\n- Hold volumn down + side button for 4 seconds \n- Release the side button, keep hold volumn down for 10 seconds\n![palera1n-cli-2](@assets/images/2024-10-15-15-08-18.png)\n\nOnce complete, this will install \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">palera1n\u003C/span> and \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">sileo\u003C/span> app on the device.\n![palera1n-result](@assets/images/2024-10-15-15-26-22.png)\n\n## Troubleshooting\nThe first issue I encountered was that SSH to iPhone on port 22 didn’t work due to changes in Palera1n, so I had to use an alternative method.\n(src: Q&A on palera1n.in)\n> password: root/mobile is alpine\n> > \n> ssh root@127.0.0.1 -o \"StrictHostKeyChecking=no\" -o \"UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\" -o \"ProxyCommand=inetcat 44\"\n\nIf you cannot use `sudo`, edit the file `ssh_config`\n\n```shell\nfind / -name sshd_config -print\nuse vim to edit \u003Csshconfig>\nPasswordAuthentication yes\n\n--------------------\nthen with sudo\nfind / -name sudo -print\n\nCreate a profile in ./\nvim .profile\nexport PATH=\"/private/preboot/[digit_string]/jb-xxxxxx/procursus/usr/bin:$PATH\"\nsource .profile\n```\n---\n\n## Revised version of the old method: [Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/)\n\n```console\n- Checkra1n: 0.12.3 version\n- MacOS\n- iPhone X, version 14.8.1\n- USB-A cable\n```\nStep 1. Remove the passcode on your iPhone. Connect iPhone to Mac with a cable, then click \u003Cspan class=\"accent\">\"Trust\"\u003C/span> this computer.\n\nStep 2. Install Checkra1n tools on your Mac. In version 0.12.3, refer to the notes.\n> A11 devices on iOS 14.0 and above require removing the passcode and enabling \"Skip A11 BPR check\" in the options. This is not recommended, but it's there.\n  \nStep 3. Open Checkra1n tool, then configure with options\n![checkra1n-config](@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-45-56.png)\n\n![checkra1n-config-2](@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-46-36.png)\n\nStep 4. Enter DFU mode, then follow the instructions on screen\n\n![dfu-mode](@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-47-07.png)\n\n\nStep 5. Once booted, you will have the Checkra1n application installed on your iPhone. This means we jailbroke successfully. Finally, we can install Cydia inside the Checkra1n app.\n\n![cydia-loader](@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-47-20.png)\n\n## References:\n- https://canijailbreak.com/\n- https://www.theiphonewiki.com/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/\n- https://ios.cfw.guide/","src/content/blog/ios-jailbreak-guide.md",[371,372,373,374,375,376,377],"@assets/images/palera1n-l.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-15-08-18.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-15-26-22.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-45-56.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-46-36.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-47-07.png","@assets/images/2024-10-15-14-47-20.png","2c780acf0fe67cfe",{"html":380,"metadata":381},"\u003Cp>Recently, I jumped back into security testing for our internal mobile app at work.

Just quick copy-paste commands to make mobile pentesting faster and way less painful.\n\n## 🛡️ My Environment Setup\n\n### Environment \nHere's my basic testing setup, nothing too fancy, just what actually works day-to-day:\n\n- **Android devices**: Google Pixel 4 (rooted with Magisk)\n- **Emulators**: Android AVD (used to be Genymotion)\n- **iOS**: iPhone X\n- **Dynamic tools**: Frida + Objection\n- **Proxy / interception**: Burp Suite & command-line tools\n\n## 📱 Android Security Testing\n\nI use a Google Pixel 4 rooted with Magisk, I won’t go into the rooting steps here, but it works perfectly with [TrustUserCertificates](https://github.com/lupohan44/TrustUserCertificates) module for Burp’s certificate setup. Once you get that working, HTTPS interception becomes a breeze.\n\nPreviously, I relied on Genymotion (great emulator, by the way), but the free version has limits, like missing biometric support, which became a headache when testing banking app flows. So I eventually switched to Android Virtual Device (AVD).\n\nThe downside? Installing AVD through Android Studio is a full-on CPU sauna, it feels like baking a cake on laptop. 🍰 So I dug into how to install and run AVD without Android Studio, which saved both disk space and sanity.\n\n1. Download Command line tools only from the [official Android page](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only).\n2. Unzip and move cmdline-tools contents so the structure looks like\n```bash\n/Users/name/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin\n```\nNotes: Create a folder name latest inside cmdline-tools.\n\n3. Add environment vars to .zshrc\n```bash\nexport ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=\"$HOME/Library/Android/sdk\"\nexport ANDROID_HOME=\"$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT\"\nexport PATH=\"$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH\"\nexport PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator\nexport PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin\n```\nthen reload \n```bash\nsource ~/.zshrc\n```\n4. Install platform-tools and emulator\n```\nsdkmanager --list\nsdkmanager platform-tools emulator\nsdkmanager \"system-images;android-34;google_apis_playstore;arm64-v8a\" \"platforms;android-34\"\n\n# using `android-34` here which is SDK for Android 14 \navdmanager create avd --name 'pixel' --package \"system-images;android-34;google_apis_playstore;arm64-v8a\" -d pixel\nemulator -avd pixel -no-snapshot-load\n```\nIf you get an error, start with the full path\n```bash\n$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd pixel -no-snapshot-load\n```\n\n5. Root AVD\n- Use [rootAVD script](https://gitlab.com/newbit/rootAVD)\n```bash\n./rootAVD.sh system-images/android-34/google_apis_playstore/arm64-v8a/ramdisk.img\n```\n\n\n## 🍎 iOS Security Testing\n\nI used Palera1n to jailbreak my iPhone X running iOS 16.7.2, check [this](/posts/ios-jailbreak-guide) out.\n\n```bash\npalera1n -l\n```\n\n## 💡 Frida\n\nMake sure the host Frida CLI and the device’s frida-server are the same version. I stick with v16.6.6 (arm64 / aarch64). \n\n```bash\nadb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi\n# or\nadb shell uname -m\nadb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/\n\n# make it executable\nadb shell \"chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server\"\n\n# run it in background (simple)\nadb shell \"/data/local/tmp/frida-server &\"\n\n# Kill Frida process\nps -e | grep frida-server\nkill -9 pid\n\n#Start Frida process\n/data/local/tmp/frida-server & \n\n# To hook a process like com.example.dev\n\nfrida -U -f com.example.dev -l script.js\n```\nThe scripts I used:\n- Flutter SSL pinning using frida-flutterproxy\n\nRepo: https://github.com/hackcatml/frida-flutterproxy\n```bash\n# change IP address \nfrida -U -f com.example.dev -l ssl-bypass.js\n```\n- Bypass talsec / RASP & root detection\n\nhttps://codeshare.frida.re/@muhammadhikmahhusnuzon/bypass-talsec-rasp-and-root-detection/\n```bash\nfrida -U -f com.example.dev -l talsec-root.js\n```\n- Bypass Universal biometric bypass\n\n```bash\nfrida -U -f com.example.dev -l universal-bio-bypass.js\n```\n---\n\n*Use this cheatsheet as a starting point for mobile security testing.*\n\n*https://github.com/flouciel/chezmoi/tree/main/mobsec*","src/content/blog/mobile-security-cheatsheet.md","027a634c4d612807",{"html":415,"metadata":416},"\u003Cp>TL;DR: I made this cheatsheet in my Obsidian notes to stop Googling the same stuff every time.
